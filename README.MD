# ig-web-api-rewrite

WIP typescript rewrite of [instagram-web-api](https://github.com/jlobos/instagram-web-api).

Aims to reduce dependencies for easier bundling into web projects using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and patch some things that have broken over the 4 years that have elapsed between the project's latest commit and the start of this rewrite.
